## Overview

A simple newsletter UI for subscribing with an email. It's responsive and interactive to make a fantastic UX experience.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [See site URL here]( https://josuez2006.github.io/newsletter-sign-up/)

## My process

1- Analyzed the design
2- Make the Html structure
3- Style for mobile devices
4- Add responsiveness
5- Create interactivity

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript RegExp

### What I learned

I learned to analized the design before jumping into code. Besides, I started commeting everything to add clarity and readability. On the other hand, I used CSS custom properties in an organized way that helped me build a great folder structure for my styles. Last but not least, I relearned how to use regexp to validate the input field.

### Continued development

To keep learning on this journey, I must check other people's code to learn how to structue my files and how to name my classes and variables in a better way. On top of that, I should include Sass to my workflow in order to be more productive.
